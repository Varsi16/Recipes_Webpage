    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oatmeal pancakes are a healthy breakfast option that can be made by
        mixing oats, flour, baking powder, eggs, and milk. Cook in a non-stick
        pan until golden brown, then serve with toppings of your choice.</p>

    <p>Oatmeal pancakes can be made healthier by using whole wheat or almond flour,
        adding ingredients like cinnamon or mashed bananas, or using almond milk and
        flax eggs for a vegan option. They are a good source of fiber and protein to
        keep you full and satisfied.</p>
